# Witchwood 2D Adventure Game

**Created by Kevin Putnam**

It is being created to celebrate the 2025 Halloween season.

It was developed using a custom JS/CSS/HTML editor that I developed to
make creating 2D top down RPG style games easier. Both the editor and engine
are very much works in progress.

See the `js_basic_game` [repository](https://github.com/kevinputnam/js_basic_game)
for more information about the underlying software. 

I will nevertheless be porting fixed bugs back to main repo as I fix them.

I am using the [Top-Down Forest Tileset](https://gametoolkit.itch.io/top-down-forest-tileset)
created by GameToolKit.com for the basic background. I have created the rest
of the assets myself in Aseprite.
